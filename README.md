meteor-admin-site
=================

A Meteor admin tool loosely inspired by the Django admin site.


Disclaimer
----------

We are in an early development stage, so the project is not fully functional.

There will be absolutely no concern about backward compatibility until version 1.0.0 is reached,
or until a more functional and stable state is reached, at the discretion of the project manager.
